This MUMmerplot shows the alignment of the assembly at a given stage against
the defined reference genome ({{ snakemake.config["ref_genome"] }}). Please see
the "stage" label in the metadata whether **contigs** or **scaffolds** are
shown. The "size" label indicates the file size of the plot: the "large" plot
has a large resolution, allowing you to zoom in more than on the "default"
plot.

This plot can be used to verify the assembly, scaffolding and renaming process
that is automated in this pipeline.
