This `pangrowth` growth curve shows the pangenome growth curve based on k-mers
for the pangenome as defined by the name "{{ snakemake.wildcards.asmset }}".

Even though this simple pangenome analysis is based on k-mers alone, it can be
taken as an estimate of what the pangenome would look like for genes. For genes,
please see the core_dispensable_total_growth.png_ upset plot generated by
`PanTools`.
