This MUMmerplot shows the alignment of the assembly at a given stage against the
defined reference genome ({{ snakemake.config["ref_genome"] }}). Please see the
"stage" label in the metadata whether **contigs** or **scaffolds** are shown.

This plot can be used to verify the assembly, scaffolding and renaming process
that is automated in this pipeline.
