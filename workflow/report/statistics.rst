The overall statistics of a defined set of assemblies as per configuration. Only
HiFi reads are shown here, even if ONT reads were used in the assembly and/or
Illumina reads for the QC.

One important remark about the (un)assigned sequences is that chromosomes that
were assembled as a single contig are counted among the unassigned sequences
instead of the assigned sequences. Otherwise, assigned sequences contain all
chromosomes.
