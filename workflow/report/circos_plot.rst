This circos plot shows all tracks as defined the configuration for the pipeline.
An overview of what each track represents (and its limits) is shown in the
{{ snakemake.wildcards.asmname }}.circos.pdf_ file.

The circos plot is not meant to be final, but rather a starting point for
creating your own circos plot. Feel free to take the provided configuration file
as a starting point and modify it to your needs.
