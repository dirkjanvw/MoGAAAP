This BUSCO plot shows the gene completeness of all assemblies and
quick-and-dirty annotations as generated by this pipeline. For each BUSCO gene,
the plot shows whether it is present (and if so, whether it is duplicated),
fragmented, or missing in each assembly.

The plot is useful for comparing the completeness of the assemblies and the
accuracy of the quick-and-dirty annotations. However, it is good to keep in mind
that missing BUSCOs can have a biological explanation. Also, the quick-and-dirty
annotations are likely biased towards more conserved genes which is what BUSCOs
are.
