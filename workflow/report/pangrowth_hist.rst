This `pangrowth` plot shows the occurrence of k-mers in the pangenome as defined
by the name "{{ snakemake.wildcards.asmset }}".

Even though this simple pangenome analysis is based on k-mers alone, it can be
taken as an estimate of what the pangenome would look like for genes. For genes,
please see the genomes.pdf_ upset plot generated by `PanTools`.
