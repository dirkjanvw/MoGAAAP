This contact map shows the scaffolding effort using Hi-C data. In this contact
map, the axes represent the groups of scaffolds that were scaffolded together.
The colour intensity represents the number of Hi-C contacts between the groups
of scaffolds. These contacts are used to determine the physical distance between
sequences in the assembly.

Ideally, a diagonal should be seen from the left bottom to the top right, with
the centromeres, telomeres and other repeats as off-diagonal signals. In case
other off-diagonal signals are present, these indicate mis-joins during the
scaffolding process (or misassemblies in the assembly). The scaffolding can be
improved manually using tools like Juicebox or 3D-DNA outside of this pipeline.
