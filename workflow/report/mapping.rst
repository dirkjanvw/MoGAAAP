This is an interactive view of all Illumina data available for this assembly.
The pipeline subsamples the provided independent Illumina data (Illumina data is
never involved in the assembly process) to 1,000,000 reads. These million reads
are then aligned to the assembly and their basic statistics can be viewed here.

Ideally, most if not all reads can be mapped perfectly to the assembly. However,
generally we see that with 99% mapping there is still no issue with the
assembly. If the mapping rate is lower, this is a reason to investigate 1) the
quality of the assembly, 2) the genetic origin of the Illumina data and see
whether it is not a mislabelled or contaminated dataset.
