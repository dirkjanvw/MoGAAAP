This is an interactive kraken2 report for the assembly. It is a summary of the
taxonomic composition of the scaffolded assembly. The percentages therefore
correspond to the fraction of sequences and not the fraction of bases
in the assembly.

This plot is very useful for identifying contamination in the assembly. When
a taxonomic group is selected, you can see the sequences that belong to that
group in the very top right when clicking on the "Count". Please also check
the {{ snakemake.wildcards.asmname }}.fcs_gx_report.html_ as an independent
analysis of contamination.
