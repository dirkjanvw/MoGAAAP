Some guides on interpreting this report:

- Workflow_: The current page. On the right, an overview of all steps in the
  pipeline is shown. Each step is clickable and will take you to a detailed
  technical overview of that step.
- Statistics_: The pipeline statistics: when was what step run and how long took
  it. In my personal experience, this page is not always accurate nor complete.
- About_: Technical details of this report; only relevant to Snakemake
  developers.
- Result_: The result section.
