Collinearity plot
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This plot (which is created for each defined set of assemblies) shows the
collinearity between the assemblies. The chromosomes are ordered alphabetically
and the collinearity is calculated by ntSynt based on unique shared minimizers
between the assemblies.

The plot is mainly useful for identifying large translocations, inversions and
duplications between the assemblies. However, it is good to keep in mind that
these can be biological in nature, or artifacts of the assembly and scaffolding
process.
