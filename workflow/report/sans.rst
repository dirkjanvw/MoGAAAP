This NEXUS file describes the phylogenetic relationship between the assemblies
in a set based on k-mers. The file can be imported into SplitsTree for
visualisation.

Ideally, the relationship between the assemblies should correspond to the known
phylogenetic relationship between the organisms. If this is not the case, it may
point to mislabeling of samples or contamination.
