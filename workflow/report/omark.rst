This OMArk plot shows the (completeness and accuracy) statistics of the
quick-and-dirty annotations. From top to bottom, it shows:

- The number of proteins in each annotation.
- The completeness of the annotated proteins, i.e. the fraction of single,
  duplicated and missing proteins.
- The phylogenetic consistency of the annotated proteins. It shows the fraction
  of proteins that are consistent with the phylogenetic placement of the
  assembly.

The plot is mostly meant as an independent comparison to the busco_figure.png_ plot. OMArk
searches all proteins instead of only those that are universally single-copy,
thereby increasing the search space.
